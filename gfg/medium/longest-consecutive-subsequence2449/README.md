# Longest Consecutive Subsequence

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

Given an array  **arr[]**  of non-negative integers. Find the  **length**  of the longest sub-sequence such that elements in the subsequence are consecutive integers, the **consecutive numbers**  can be in  **any order.** 

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: arr[] = [2, 6, 1, 9, 4, 5, 3]
Output: 6
Explanation: The consecutive numbers here are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. These 6 numbers form the longest consecutive subsquence.
```

```
Input: arr[] = [1, 9, 3, 10, 4, 20, 2]
Output: 4
Explanation: 1, 2, 3, 4 is the longest consecutive subsequence.
```

```
Input: arr[] = [15, 13, 12, 14, 11, 10, 9]
Output: 7
Explanation: The longest consecutive subsequence is 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, which has a length of 7.

```

	    Arrays.sort(arr);
	    int count =1;
	    int longest = 1;
	    
	    for(int i =1;i<arr.length;i++){
	        
	        if(arr[i] == arr[i-1]){
	            continue;
	        }
	        if(arr[i] == arr[i-1] +1){
	            count ++;
	        }
	        else{
	            count =1;
	        }
	        longest = Math.max(longest, count);
	    }
	    return longest;
	    
	    
	    
	   // Time Limit Exceeded 
	/*	int longest = 0;

			while (LinearSearch(arr, current + 1)) {
				current++;

			}
			longest = Math.max(longest, count);
		}
		return longest;
		
	}
	public boolean LinearSearch(int[] arr, int target) {
		for (int i = 0; i<arr.length; i++) {
			if (arr[i] == target) {
				return true;
			}

		return false;
