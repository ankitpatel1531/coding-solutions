# Rotate Array by One

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Basic-red)

## Problem

Given an array  **arr**, rotate the array by one position in clockwise direction.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: [5, 1, 2, 3, 4]
Explanation: If we rotate arr by one position in clockwise 5 come to the front and remaining those are shifted to the end.
```

```
Input: arr[] = [9, 8, 7, 6, 4, 2, 1, 3]
Output: [3, 9, 8, 7, 6, 4, 2, 1]
Explanation: After rotating clock-wise 3 comes in first position.
```

 **Constraints:** 
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 105
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 105

```java
class Solution {
    public void rotate(int[] arr) {
        int n = arr.length;
        
        int temp = arr[n-1];
        
        for(int i =n-1;i>0;i--){
            arr[i]=arr[i-1];
        }
        arr[0] = temp;
        // return arr;
    }
}
```
